# drawing-in-the-terminal
repository for the NYUAD Interactive Media Workshop on September 18th


### Topics

This workshop fill focus on the creative constraints that appear when you want to draw in systems that, well, weren't designed to let you draw. One of the very first examples is that of Tennis For Two, a 2-player computer game when William Higginbotham, in **1958** (!) forced an oscilloscope to display what ended up looking like [a tennis court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2E9iSQfGdg).

Later on, when computers democratized, amateur programmers started messing around with the Commodore 64, creating [mazes]() and [waves]() or with the TRS-80, creating [snowfalls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGitwpsw2qI).

The limitation of tools has always been one avenue for developing both creative ideas and creative ways to figure out how to do something.


### Tools

In this workshop, it is encouraged to use [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/), as well as the following packages:
- [blessings](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blessings), a wrapper for curses, simplifying movement and color in the terminal.
- [noise](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/noise/1.2.2), an implementation of [Perlin noise](http://www.noisemachine.com/offline/).

Both can be installed by `running pip install <nameofpackage>`.
